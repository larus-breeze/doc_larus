# Installation

<img width="300" alt="Warning" src="Images/yellowWarning.svg" />|Usually, LARUS Vario Display is powered by LARUS via patch cable between the CAN ports. LARUS needs to be protected by an external fuse (500 mA to max. 3A) like it is common practice for all electric devices in aviation. If LARUS gets its energy from another main instrument (e.g. SteFly NAV via D-Sub connector) please make sure that the main instrument is protected by an external fuse. |

## Installation Location

The following picture shows a typical installation situation of LARUS Vario Display in the instrument panel of a glider.
