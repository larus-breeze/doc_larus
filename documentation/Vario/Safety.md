# Proper Use
LARUS Vario Display visualises data which are measured and calculated by the LARUS sensor box. LARUS was designed to calculate direction and strength of thermals and wind quickly and reliably. Therefore, the sensor unit combines data from high-precision sensors and GNSS receivers in sophisticated algorithms. 

LARUS Vario Display shall be installed in the instrument panel.

LARUS gliding sensor unit is an additional feature to supply glider pilots with accurate information about wind, vertical air movement as well as additional attitude of the aircraft. Its use is limited to day VFR conditions. Security decisions must be made regardless of having installed LARUS.

# Improper Use

Improper use will cause all claims for liability and guarantees to be forfeited. Improper use is deemed to be all use for purposes deviating from those mentioned above, especially:
* Using LARUS data in non-VFR conditions or during night is forbidden. LARUS is not certified. Although LARUS provides AHRS data to XCSoar you must not rely on the artificial horizon display.

* Using LARUS data during aerobatics or during flight conditions with high angle of attack (stall) or high g-forces. The algorithm was optimized for normal flight conditions.  

* Operating LARUS Vario Display outside the operation conditions defined in technical data section, e.g. input voltage, temperature and humidity.
